secret-santa-java
=================

A basic Java application for assigning secret santa pairs for a group of friends, family or coworkers.
For an explanation of the tradition, I have provided a link to the Secret Santa wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa.

Libraries
I have used the JavaMail(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138643.html) library to send emails, which aslo requires the Java Application Framework library (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index-135046.html). Both are provided.
